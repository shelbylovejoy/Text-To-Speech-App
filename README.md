# Text-To-Speech-App

This project was for my Advanced Topics class. We had to find a tutorial online and recreate it but with an added element. My tutorial is linked below. My extra element was adding many different accents which I had to download to my computer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEL8ihL-GXg
